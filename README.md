# ShortestPath
//The type of graph is directed and the edges weight are time from vertex to vertex. vertex's are A-Z so limit of vertex's for this program is 26

//This is a simple program to read certian text files to translate them into a adjacency list effectivley making a directed graph for the user to analysis visually through 
//the terminal, current analysis options are the adjacency list analysis when chosen outputs the adjacency list in a clean format then prompts user to select a vertex "A-Z"
//to look up specifically its out degree, the adjacent vertex's and the amount of time it would take to travel to such vertex (# located in the paranthesis)
//Second option is to create a "shortest path table" through the use of Dikstra's algorithm that allows the user to see the table and look up specific paths and amount of time 
//from given vertex to another. The last option being a visualizations of a Depth first search through the use of stacks that show step by step of the marking of how a DFS 
//visits certain vertex's

//This project is still very much a work in progress!
